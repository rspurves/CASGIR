**Finding placenames**
This project illustrates an application to find new placenames in a dataset, by performing NER on [Geograph](https://geograph.org.uk) image descriptions and comparing those with an [Ordnance Survey](https://ordnancesurvey.co.uk) gazetteer. It uses a simple local index to compare gazetteer entries, and only allows exact matching.
