**Finding placenames**
This project illustrates an application to find new placenames in a dataset, by performing NER on [Geograph](https://geograph.org.uk) image descriptions and comparing those with an [Ordnance Survey](https://ordnancesurvey.co.uk) gazetteer. It uses a simple local index to compare gazetteer entries, and only allows exact matching. It is available in Binder for experimentation: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/rspurves/geo871Experiments/main?labpath=geo871_placename_experiments.ipynb)

**Comparing documents**
This project illustrates an application to compare file content using cosine similarity. A simple version build binary vectors of parts of speech, and calculates cosine similarity on that basis, while a second version uses Spacy's inbuilt word2vec version. You can try it out here: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/rspurves/geo871Experiments/main?labpath=geo871_similarity.ipynb)
